CS535 Big Data
Level: Graduate students

Course Description
Storage, retrieval, analysis, and knowledge discovery using Big Data has made significant inroads in several domains in industry, research, and academia. In this course, we will look at the dominant software systems and algorithms for coping with the scale of Big Data. Topics covered include scalable computing models such as distributed machine learning and approximate algorithms for the real-time streaming data.  Also, we discuss large-scale non-traditional data storage frameworks including graph, key-value, and column-family storage systems.
